Create a java class Circle as described below: radius: a double PI: a final double initialized with the value 3.14159 The class should have the following methods: calculateArea – Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as: area = PI * radius * radius calculateDiameter – Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as: diameter = radius * 2 calculateCircumference – Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as: circumference = 2 * PI * radius setRadius – A mutator (setter) method for the radius field getRadius – An accessor (getter) method for the radius field Create test data and calculate the expected result. Input Expected Results Radius Area Diameter Circumference – – – – – – – – – – – – Write a program name CircleDriver that demonstrates the Circle class by asking the user for the circle’s radius, creating a Circle object, and then reporting the circle’s area, diameter, and circumference.
